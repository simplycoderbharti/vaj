          Indonesia is one of the world's largest coal producers and exporters. The country has vast coal reserves, with significant deposits in Sumatra and Kalimantan. Indonesian coal is known for its relatively low ash and sulfur content, making it a popular choice for both domestic use and international export.

The coal industry is a major contributor to Indonesia's economy, providing employment and generating substantial revenue. The country's strategic location and developed infrastructure for coal mining and shipping facilitate efficient production and export, primarily to major markets in Asia, including China, India, Japan, and South Korea.
